## Brief background

Three years ago, there was an attempt to write a game in a very specific language ActionScript 2.0 and place it as a VK application. Unfortunately, almost no one paid attention to it then, and then VKontakte completely stopped supporting Flash, and the game went into oblivion. So, we gathered here to breathe a second life into it, complete the crooked moments and re-implement it for Android!
By the way, the latest version can be found [here](https://yadi.sk/d/VxMuGKmkwqCVVg)

## What is it?

«Gravity and Shawarma» is a completely new space game where you have to plow the expanses of the Universe in search of shawarma - an alternative fuel and currency of the future! Each planet in the game has an attractive force affecting the trajectory of your flight. To pass the levels you have to travel through space through the "wormholes", go into the orbits of the planets, resist gravity or follow it.
